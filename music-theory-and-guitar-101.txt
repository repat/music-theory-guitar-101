A couple of things are oversimplified as this is already a lot to take in.
Pull Requests welcome, it's a work in progress

0 Equipment|
-----------
* Guitar
* Capo (e.g. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014MQ22XU)
* Tuner or Tuner App (e.g. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MR6IHK)
* Plectrum ("Pick")
* Paper + Pen for notes


I Piano|
-------
     C#   D#        F#   G#   A#
|   |||  |||   |   |||  |||  |||   |  ||
|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |   | ...
|____|____|____|____|____|____|____|___|
   C    D   E     F    G    A    B    C'

* The order is: C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# C'
* C' means it's the next C and sounds higher than the C before
* For simplification the accidentals (black keys) are only marked with a sharp sign (#), never with a flat (b)
* Example: F#/Gb is just F# here
* From each key to the next it's 1/2 tone (semitone or half tone), whether or not it's to a black key or a white key
* Example: From C (white key) to C# (black key) is a half tone, from E to F is a half tone too (no black key in between)


II Guitar|
---------
* There are two main (acoustic) guitar types: steel strings or nylon strings
* Guitars have 6 strings and 12+ frets
* Frets are separated by little metal sticks, the fingers go in between those
* Counting begins at the thinnest (1st) string and ends at the thickest (6th) string
* Frets are marked on the top with little dots, mostly at (3,) 5, 7, 9 and a double dot for 12
* From each fret to the next it's 1/2 tone
* The keys of the strings are from top to bottom E A D G B E
* Mnemonic: Eat All Day Get Big Easy
* [Bass Guitars only have the last 4 strings: E A D G]
* [Tune guitar A frequency to 440 Hz to play with other instruments (e.g. Piano or Bass Guitar)]
* Sometimes the last E is noted as E'
* This is called Standard Tuning, but there are many more, especially for electric guitar (power chords - see IIX)
* Example: DADGBE ("Drop-D"), CDCFAD ("Drop-C") or all string half a key down are common
* It's possible to tune up the whole guitar (transpose) with a capo because it presses all strings
* More on capo in IV

II.1 (Dis-)Advantages Steelstring
+/- frets are smaller, hands don't have to be stretched as much (good for children)
+ better for chords
+ easier to re-string
- Steel hurts the fingers more while pressing down

II.2 (Dis-)Advantages Nylon
+/- frets are bigger, fingers don't get in each others way
+ mostly cheaper
- not as good for chords

- Nirvanas "About A Girl"

* Most guitar players use a system called tabs instead of traditional music notes
* The numbers are the frets to press the fingers down in
* The lines the strings with the one on top being the 1st string (see II)
* A 0 means the string is played with not finger pressed anywhere
* Numbers/tones are played from left to right. If numbers are above each other (see IV), they are played at the same time
* Other notations include X (string not played), pm (palm muted), h (hammer on), p (pull-off) and ~ (let ring)


IV Chords|
----------
* A chord consists of a minimum of three tones played at the same time
* For simplification we'll only look at minor and major chords
* Minor chords are noted with a small letter (+m), major chords a capital letter
* Minor chords consists of the base + 3 half steps + 4 half steps
* Major chords consists of the base + 4 half steps + 3 half steps
* Look at the piano, that makes it easier
* Example em: e + g  + b
* Example E:  e + g# + b
* From minor to major, only the middle tone needs to be moved 1/2 tone up, since the sum of half tones is 3+4=7
* Because there are 6 strings, tones in a chord can be played twice or even 3 times

E |--0--| ---------------------> E
B |--0--| ---------------------> B
G |--0--| ---------------------> G
D |--2--| --> D + 2 half tones = E
A |--2--| --> A + 2 half tones = B
E |--0--| ---------------------> E

* Example: em consists of E (3x), G (1x), B (2x) (see examples earlier)
* There are many more chords, e.g. in Jazz or Blues
* There are chords where the first index finger needs to press down all 6 strings called bar chords
* Focus on normal chords as bar chords are harder to learn
* Bar chords include: All minor and major sharp (#) chords, cm, F, fm, gm, B and bm
* All chords can also be played as bar chords
* All chords can be played with a capo, but they will all be higher depending on capo position
* Example Capo: Capo on 1st fret, all tones are 1/2 tone higher -> em chord is now fm chord]


V 4 Chord Songs|
----------------
* Watch "4 chord song" by "Axis of Awesome": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I
* Most pop songs have one simple chord progression made out of 4 chords, repeated over and over
* The chords vary in key, but the interval between them is always the same, see example
* The chords are called: Tonic, parallel minor, subdominant, dominant
* Example C-Major: C (tonic), am (minor parallel), F (subdominant), G (dominant)

                   |           |                   |                |
                   v           v                   v                v

* Example G-Major: G (tonic), em (minor parallel), C (subdominant), D (dominant)
* They sometimes marked as tonic (I), minor parallel (vi), subdominant (IV) and dominant (V)
* Mostly played in this order: I - V - vi - IV, e.g. G, D, em, C
* There is only one progression that doesn't involve bar chords (see IV) and it's G-Major: G em C D
* Use capo to transpose G-Major chord progression to music you're playing or to match your singing range

E |--0--|--2------|--2------|--0--|--2---|
B |--0--|--0------|--2------|--1--|--3---|
G |--0--|--0------|--0------|--0--|--2---|
D |--2--|--0------|--0------|--2--|--0---|
A |--2--|--2------|--2------|--3--|--X---|
E |--0--|--3------|--3------|--X--|--X---|

    em     G (v1)    G (v2)    C     D

* Both Gs can be played, v2 sounds "fuller"
* The first string on the C and the first 2 strings on D should not be played
* It's possible to use the thumb to mute strings or just play precisely with the right hand
* When Xs are not played softly in a chord nontheless, it's mostly not very noticable to an untrained ear
